# web_hacking

<i><b><script>prompt("hack to learn")</script></b></i>

network diagnoses first
-- connection probls..
resolve.conf messed up due to overwrite issues
--> apt purge resolvconf && reboot

- first of all, try to automate words' spelling. Create bash profiles_
--> ~/bash.rc; ~/.profile ... whatever
--> alias <comandname> = "<commandsyntax"
--> source ~/<edited_profile_name>
  
  <b> Some small bash scripting notes as well</b>
  - if a word is on the directory or something: 
  -- if [ -d "word"] then echo "word is here"; 
  -- (condition not true [! -d "word"] then echo "word not"
  
Now, steps to think of before approaching a real target:
- recon script in sh for general view
- nikto for knowing what's in the url
- whatweb to find out tech and stuff
- dirb general folders present, dirsearch, gobuster, whatever
- check admin folders through custom script running through a file with default admin main folders
- copy entire website to local folder, options with wget, different approaches
- js files: hidden endpoints, comments, calls
- gotta love js files.. embrace them with: grep -Er 'href="[^\"]+"'; grep -Er '(http|https)://[^/"]+'; grep -Er 'hidden'; grep -Er '[0-9][0-9][0-9].[0-9][0-9][0-9].[0-9][0-9][0-9]'
- check forms in the entire website, which properties do they have (hidden; kind of action or where are they supposed to bring
submitted information to - :action /post <some_end_path>

- osinter script: social media, digital dumpsters, digital cemetery
- httprequests_list scripto on all the folders in the domain

Attacks:
- XSS: reflected, stored and DOM-based
- SQLi, including blind
- CSRF
- Broken Access & Weak Management Sessions
- CRLF
- IDOR's
- HTTP parameter pollution
- Security Misconfiguration --> mostly leading to information disclosure situations
- OS & command execution
- Path traversal
- domain || subdomain takeover through dns dig records
- sensitive data online exposed: digital dumpster, osinter, digital cemetery

<b>More specific procedures</b>:
- add xss payload to see handling of double qutores or angle brackets
- test html5 attributes such as onload, onerror, etc, in elements like an img tag
- use and abuse csrf tokens and try to delete content both by GET and POST, see the answer from the server
- how is an account identifier treated or processed by the server? In the URL, is it passwd with a POST call? Try to modify it and access others
- does the site take a url parameter to load a resource? Try to change the value of that parameter.



Vectors for gathering some sort of information_
- Plugins
- HTML5 Canvas Image Extractionj
- Open TCP Port and Local Network Fingerprinting
- Invasive Authentication Mechanisms (NTLM and SPNEGO)
- USB Device ID Enumeration via the GamePad API
- Fonts
- Monitor, Widget and OS Desktop Resolution
- Display Media Information
- WebGL
- User agent and HTTP Headers
- Locale Fingerprinting
- Timezone and Clock Offset
- Javascript Performance Fingerprinting
- Keystroke Fingerprinting
- Operating System Type Fingerprinting

<b>Web apps general vulnerabilities</b>:
- misconfigurations
- default installations
- buffer overflows
- unpatched servers
- design flaws
- operation system flaws
- application flaws
- open services
- default passwords

<i>More technical stuff</i>
- Injection
- Broken authentication
- Sensitive Data Exposure
- XML enternal Entity
- Broken Access Control
- Security Misconfiguration
- XSS
- Insecure Deserialization
- Components with known vulns
- Insuficient Logging and monitoring


WAF's_

- Get to know cookies through GET requests (cookies are the new black).
- Make requests without user-agent.
- Requests to other open ports and grab the banners.
- Login page? Try ungenious and dummy payload like " or 1 = 1 --.
- Input fields like search bars, submissions, whatever, make some more noise <script>alert()</script>, invest more on prompt() or confirm().
- Put ../../../etc/passwd in a random parameter at the end of url or something. More common if the site is passing variable information
and stuff like that via GET and data is on the actual URL. Attach also ' OR SLEEP(5) OR '.
- GET requests with outdated protocols - HTTP/0.9 (for example) - or others older.
- Hping the application using FIN and RST and analyse response.
- Drop Action Technique - Send a raw crafted FIN/RST packet to server and identify response.
